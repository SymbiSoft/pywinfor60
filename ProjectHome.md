this is for mobile phones .(nokia n95,n70,e90,n8 etc)

I have no computer so i want computer window and mouse pointer in my mobile.
A pygtk for symbian is now iam doing.
this is related to that


In this  2014 it may be waste.because everyone leave symbian.and moved to android (linux).

iam doing this from scrach (means without help from internet or anyother).

I think i can get a bit knowlege in this area  by doing this.

So the benefit i get is only a bit knowlege.
